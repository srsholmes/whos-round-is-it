# react-hybrid-starter
### Very much a work in progress, the builds are currently broken!

A boilerplate using ReactJS, SASS, Gulp, and Browserify.
The boilerplate features hot reloading using LiveReactload.

The Boilerplate acts as a barebones project for you to share code between a React web application and a React Native application.


### Getting up and running for web.

1. Run `npm install` from the root directory
2. Run `npm start`

### Getting up and running for React-Native.

1. Run `npm install` from the root directory
2. Run `npm native-start`
